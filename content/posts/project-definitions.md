summary: "What do I mean by Project?"
---

A **project** is anything I want to build that will take a non-trivial amount of time.
Each project must have:
* a name
* a (preferably quippy) aim/goal
* some sort of documentation -- either on my blog, my wiki, or a README
* a status

## Status Options

[**Idea**](/tags/idea) – an idea for a future project, maybe some research or links, nothing significant started yet; only for things that I realistically might complete

[**In Progress**](/tags/in-progress) – a project I am actively working on and intend to finish

[**Indefinite Hiatus**](/tags/indefinite-hiatus) – a project I started and have a non-trivial amount completed but probably will not ever fulfill the entire idea

[**Completed**](/tags/completed) – a project that is done. Dead in the water. Sold as is, no refunds, no exchanges.

[**Maintained**](/tags/maintained) – a project that is done but still needs to be updated, checked on, fixed when broken, etc.

[**Ruled Out**](/tags/ruled-out) – a project that didn't work out, an idea that was too impractical or time-consuming; I don't want to delete it but I'm not really going to do anything about it
