Do I dislike swearing? No.
{{< quote >}}
Under certain circumstances, profanity provides a relief denied even to prayer.

(For example, there was an episode of MythBusters where they proved swearing can slightly alleviate pain.)

I don't {{< note >}}(read: I *try* not to){{< /note >}} look down on people for swearing. It's a cultural thing! There's nothing wrong with swearing.

Do I made a conscious effort not to swear? No. It's just who I am.
{{< quote >}}
If you're doing silly stuff, you're not tempted to swear.

I do think, however, that swearing is often used as a crutch.
{{< quote >}}
Writing for adults often means just increasing the swearing -- but find an alternative to swearing and you've probably got a better line.
{{< /quote >}}
Emphasis on "probably." Lazy writers often use swearing as a shortcut to make a point. He swore -- so it must be serious! He is angry! This is a show *for adults only!*

There are times when swearing can enhance writing (e.g., [Quote Swear Unquote](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuoteSwearUnquote))...but rarely.

The above completely ignores the fact that swearing is often used as a reason to keep children away from media. If you are writing content that is appropriate for children (and I am!), you don't want to give adults any ground to stand on.

For all of these reasons, I use Good Place Swear Words.
